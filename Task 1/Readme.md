# Data Science & Business Analytics Internship - The Spark Foundation
Batch: November 23

## Predicting Student Scores Based on Study Hours

In this project, I delved into the captivating realm of Data Science and Business Analytics within The Spark Foundation's November 23 batch. My main objective involved forecasting a student's score percentage by utilizing a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques, with the number of study hours serving as a pivotal factor.

Let's break it down into key steps and showcasing essential metrics.

# Step 1: Importing Libraries
To get started, I imported essential Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries played a crucial role in data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

# Step 2: Loading and Understanding the Dataset
Within the dataset, there are entries for 25 students, with two columns labeled 'Hours' and 'Scores.' I delved into the characteristics of the dataset, examining properties such as data types and summary statistics.

# Step 3: Data Visualization
Creating a scatter plot helped us understand the connection between study hours and scores, providing a clear picture of the correlation between these two variables.

# Step 4: Data Preparation
To prepare for modeling, I partitioned the dataset into training and testing sets. This division was crucial to guarantee the precision of our predictive model.

# Step 5: Linear Regression Model
A Linear Regression model was employed to predict student scores based on study hours. I extracted essential model parameters, including coefficients and the intercept.

# Step 6: Result Visualization
To assess the model's performance, I contrasted its predictions with the actual scores. Visual aids like scatter plots and a regression line were employed to offer a transparent depiction of the model's efficacy.

# Step 7: Model Evaluation
I assessed the model using key performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error: 4.97
Mean Square Error: 28.88
R2 Score: 0.95

# Outcomes
Completing this project yielded several notable outcomes:

Built a strong predictive model to estimate student scores by leveraging study hours. Acquired practical skills in handling data, visualizing insights, and implementing machine learning with Python. Assessed the model's effectiveness using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R2 Score, achieving an impressive R2 Score of 0.94. This project marks a substantial achievement in my Data Science journey, providing me with valuable expertise for future pursuits.
